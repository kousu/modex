<!--

pourover is not at all what I thought it would be
but I can probably work with it, though inefficiently
 the trouble is that pourover is heavily designed around a single use case: dataset drilldown.
  you can construct slices (MatchSets) and it has something it calls views which (using View.setSelection()) you can give particular subsets targets
  but, every view is tied back to the single global set of "filters" (a filter essentially being an parameterized where clause--unapplyed (so e.g. you can have a filter that represents "where $1 in hobbies")), and each filter
 But, I *can* replicate use its filtering 

another irritant: PourOver mutates the objects you give it, attaching a primary key (cid) to each.
 
 i just want to load my data as needed!
 I wonder how erlang handles this

crossfilter is specifically a cross-filter: each crossfilter instance is *one* view; in particular, filtering on any dimension (i.e. object property) filters all the others too, so there's no way
 at doing that one specific thing, though, an updateable view, it is excellent 

lets see if i can get a websocket talking to replicate.py, at least
 make a script that sucks less

/*
 * plan:
 *
 *  1) [x] get Pourover running so that I can play with it in the js console
 *  2) [x] get Pourover updating
 *  3) write a script which launches one replicate_server.py per interesting table a websocket (websockify + socat ftw)  and get
 *  3b) make sure multiple browsers are actually able to get the same stream of data
 *  4) set a js trigger on pourover (does pourover allow this?? it must...) so that updates trigger something
 *  5) write draw(data) 
 *   -- xxx it would be better; though it's not clear to me that d3 does this properly; it seems d3 computes a diff between two complete datasets every timestep, which sort of flies in the face of all the work I've done to be able to only compute on edge-triggers
 * 
 * 
 * later problems:  figure out what the inconsistencies that Postgres dislikes in SimulationLog are
 *     
 *
 *  so... is each table being replicated a different collection? probably!
 *   first draft probably only needs one table, anyway.

   //  it is actually biased towards stateful, with a lot of glue code that handles figuring out what any particular write means to the current substates (i.e. views) it is tracking

   // It seeeeems (I haven't exhuastively read the code to check) that 'change' is meant for the data and 'update' is meant for views (i.e. when they are paged or a query is added or whatnot)
   //  To my mind filtering a view is a form of data update, but I can see why you might want to distinguish the cases.
   // Another confusing thing about the API: the docs claim you can have multiple views, however the only way to edit a view is by saying collection.filters.filter.query()--so shouldn't all views share the same??
   
   // collection.addItems triggers "change" but not "update"; a view triggers both. PourOver's notion of events is the dead simple one that other js libs like: a string plus maybe an extra js object (which is null if not given)
